shadowsocks-libev for Debian
----------------------------

The Debian package has added systemd support. A default server service which
reads the default configuration in /etc/default/shadowsocks-libev is installed
and enabled by default, plus some other service templates placed in
/lib/systemd/system, which can be used by users later.

The systemd service templates accept one parameter to determine the
configuration json file that is used by this instance. For example,
if the user starts a service called "shadowsocks-libev-local@foobar.service",
This service instance will start the "ss-local" client and read
/etc/shadowsocks-libev/foobar.json as its configuration file.
