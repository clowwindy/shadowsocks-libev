.SH DESCRIPTION
\*(Me is a lightweight and secure socks5 proxy. It is a port of the original
shadowsocks created by clowwindy. \*(Me is written in pure C and takes advantage
of \fBlibev\fP to achieve both high performance and low resource consumption.
.PP
\*(Me consists of five components.
\*(Ma(1) is a controller for multi-user management and traffic statistics, using UNIX
domain socket to talk with \*(Se(1). Also, it provides a UNIX domain socket or IP based
API for other software. About the details of this API, please refer to the following
\fBPROTOCOL\fR section.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-s \fIserver_host\fP
Set the server's hostname or IP.
.TP
.B \-p \fIserver_port\fP
Set the server's port number.
.TP
.B \-l \fIlocal_port\fP
Set the local port number.
.TP
.B \-k \fIpassword\fP
Set the password. The server and the client should use the same password.
.TP
.B \-m \fIencrypt_method\fP
Set the cipher.

\*(Me accepts 18 different ciphers: table, rc4, rc4-md5,
aes-128-cfb, aes-192-cfb, aes-256-cfb, bf-cfb, camellia-128-cfb,
camellia-192-cfb, camellia-256-cfb, cast5-cfb, des-cfb, idea-cfb, rc2-cfb,
seed-cfb, salsa20, chacha20 and chacha20-ietf. The default cipher is \fItable\fP.

If built with PolarSSL or custom OpenSSL libraries, some of these ciphers may
not work.
.TP
.B \-f \fIpid_file\fP
Start shadowsocks as a daemon with specific pid file.
.TP
.B \-t \fItimeout\fP
Set the socket timeout in seconds. The default value is 10.
.TP
.B \-c \fIconfig_file\fP
Use a configuration file.
.TP
.B \-i \fIinterface\fP
Specify network interface to bind.
.TP
.B \-b \fIlocal_address\fP
Specify local address to bind.
.TP
.B \-a \fIuser_name\fP
Run as a specific user.
.TP
.B \-u
Enable UDP relay.
.TP
.B \-U
Enable UDP relay and disable TCP relay.
.TP
.B \-A
Enable onetime authentication.
.TP
.B \--manager-address \fIpath_to_unix_domain\fP
Specify UNIX domain socket address for the communication between ss-manager and
ss-server.

Only available in server and manager mode.
.TP
.B \--executable \fIpath_to_server_executable\fP
Specify the executable path of ss-server.

Only available in manager mode.
.TP
.B \-v
Enable verbose mode.

.SH PROTOCOL
\*(Ma(1) provides several APIs through UDP protocol:

    Send UDP commands in the following format to the manager-address provided to \*(Ma(1).

        command: [JSON data]

    To add a port:

        add: {"server_port": 8001, "password":"7cd308cc059"}

    To remove a port:

        remove: {"server_port": 8001}

    To receive a pong:

        ping

    Then \*(Ma(1) will send back the traffic statistics:

        stat: {"8001":11370}

.SH EXAMPLE
To use \*(Ma(1), First start it and specify necessary information.
Then communicate with \*(Ma(1) through UNIX Domain Socket using UDP protocol:

    # Start the manager. Arguments for ss-server will be passed to generated
    # ss-server process(es) respectively.
    ss-manager --manager-address /tmp/manager.sock --executable \
$(which ss-server) -s example.com -m aes-256-cfb -c /path/to/config.json

    # Connect to the socket. Using netcat-openbsd as an example.
    # You should use scripts or other programs for further management.
    nc -Uu /tmp/manager.sock

After that, you may communicate with \*(Ma(1) as described above in the
\fBPROTOCOL\fR section.
