.SH DESCRIPTION
\*(Me is a lightweight and secure socks5 proxy. It is a port of the original
shadowsocks created by clowwindy. \*(Me is written in pure C and takes advantage
of \fBlibev\fP to achieve both high performance and low resource consumption.
.PP
\*(Me consists of five components. \*(Tu(1) is a tool for local port forwarding.
See \fBOPTIONS\fR section for special option needed by \*(Tu(1).
For more information, check out \fBshadowsocks-libev\fR(8).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-s \fIserver_host\fP
Set the server's hostname or IP.
.TP
.B \-p \fIserver_port\fP
Set the server's port number.
.TP
.B \-l \fIlocal_port\fP
Set the local port number.
.TP
.B \-k \fIpassword\fP
Set the password. The server and the client should use the same password.
.TP
.B \-m \fIencrypt_method\fP
Set the cipher.

Shadowsocks accepts 16 different ciphers: table, rc4, rc4-md5,
aes-128-cfb, aes-192-cfb, aes-256-cfb, bf-cfb, camellia-128-cfb,
camellia-192-cfb, camellia-256-cfb, cast5-cfb, des-cfb, idea-cfb, rc2-cfb,
seed-cfb, salsa20 and chacha20. The default cipher is \fItable\fP.

If built with PolarSSL or custom OpenSSL libraries, some of these ciphers may
not work.
.TP
.B \-f \fIpid_file\fP
Start shadowsocks as a daemon with specific pid file.
.TP
.B \-t \fItimeout\fP
Set the socket timeout in seconds. The default value is 10.
.TP
.B \-c \fIconfig_file\fP
Use a configuration file.
.TP
.B \-i \fIinterface\fP
Specify network interface to bind.
.TP
.B \-b \fIlocal_address\fP
Specify local address to bind.
.TP
.B \-a \fIuser_name\fP
