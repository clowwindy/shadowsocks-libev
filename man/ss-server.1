.SH DESCRIPTION
\*(Me is a lightweight and secure socks5 proxy. It is a port of the original
shadowsocks created by clowwindy. \*(Me is written in pure C and takes advantage
of \fBlibev\fP to achieve both high performance and low resource consumption.
.PP
\*(Me consists of five components. \*(Se(1) runs on a remote server to provide
secured tunnel service. For more information, check out \fBshadowsocks-libev\fR(8).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-s \fIserver_host\fP
Set the server's hostname or IP.
.TP
.B \-p \fIserver_port\fP
Set the server's port number.
.TP
.B \-l \fIlocal_port\fP
Set the local port number.
.TP
.B \-k \fIpassword\fP
Set the password. The server and the client should use the same password.
.TP
.B \-m \fIencrypt_method\fP
Set the cipher.

\*(Me accepts 18 different ciphers: table, rc4, rc4-md5,
aes-128-cfb, aes-192-cfb, aes-256-cfb, bf-cfb, camellia-128-cfb,
camellia-192-cfb, camellia-256-cfb, cast5-cfb, des-cfb, idea-cfb, rc2-cfb,
seed-cfb, salsa20, chacha20 and chacha20-ietf. The default cipher is \fItable\fP.

If built with PolarSSL or custom OpenSSL libraries, some of these ciphers may
not work.
.TP
.B \-f \fIpid_file\fP
Start shadowsocks as a daemon with specific pid file.
.TP
.B \-t \fItimeout\fP
Set the socket timeout in seconds. The default value is 10.
.TP
.B \-c \fIconfig_file\fP
Use a configuration file.
.TP
.B \-n \fInofile\fP
Specify max number of open files.

Only avaliable on Linux.
.TP
.B \-i \fIinterface\fP
Specify network interface to bind.
.TP
.B \-a \fIuser_name\fP
Run as a specific user.
.TP
.B \-u
Enable UDP relay.
.TP
.B \-U
Enable UDP relay and disable TCP relay.
.TP
.B \-A
Enable onetime authentication.
.TP
.B \-d \fIaddr\fP
Setup name servers for internal DNS resolver (libudns). The default server
is fetched from /etc/resolv.conf.
.TP
.B \--fast-open
Enable TCP fast open.

Only available with Linux kernel > 3.7.0.
.TP
.B \--acl \fIacl_config\fP
Enable ACL (Access Control List) and specify config file.
.TP
.B \--manager-address \fIpath_to_unix_domain\fP
Specify UNIX domain socket address for the communication between ss-manager and
ss-server.

Only available in server and manager mode.
.TP
.B \-v
Enable verbose mode.

.SH EXAMPLE
It is recommended to use a config file when starting \*(Se(1).
The config file is written in JSON and is easy to edit. Check out the
\fBSEE ALSO\fR section for the default path of config file.

    # Start the ss-server
    ss-server -c /etc/shadowsocks-libev/config.json

.SH BUGS
The config file of shadowsocks-libev is slightly different from original
shadowsocks. In order to listen to both ipv4/ipv6 address, use the following
grammar in your config json file:

    {
        "server":["[::0]","0.0.0.0"],
        ...
    }
