.SH DESCRIPTION
\*(Me is a lightweight and secure socks5 proxy. It is a port of the original
shadowsocks created by clowwindy. \*(Me is written in pure C and takes advantage
of \fBlibev\fP to achieve both high performance and low resource consumption.
.PP
\*(Me consists of five components. \*(Lo(1) works as a standard socks5 proxy
on local machines to proxy TCP traffic. For more information, check out \fBshadowsocks-libev\fR(8).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-s \fIserver_host\fP
Set the server's hostname or IP.
.TP
.B \-p \fIserver_port\fP
Set the server's port number.
.TP
.B \-l \fIlocal_port\fP
Set the local port number.
.TP
.B \-k \fIpassword\fP

Set the cipher.

Shadowsocks accepts 16 different ciphers: table, rc4, rc4-md5,
aes-128-cfb, aes-192-cfb, aes-256-cfb, bf-cfb, camellia-128-cfb,
camellia-192-cfb, camellia-256-cfb, cast5-cfb, des-cfb, idea-cfb, rc2-cfb,
seed-cfb, salsa20 and chacha20. The default cipher is \fItable\fP.

If built with PolarSSL or custom OpenSSL libraries, some of these ciphers may
not work.
.TP
.B \-f \fIpid_file\fP

Set the socket timeout in seconds. The default value is 10.
.TP
.B \-c \fIconfig_file\fP
Use a configuration file.
.TP
.B \-i \fIinterface\fP
Specify network interface to bind.
.TP
.B \-b \fIlocal_address\fP
Specify local address to bind.
.TP
.B \-a \fIuser_name\fP
Run as a specific user.
